1. Blog posts go in `blog/_post/` folder. As per jekyll convention they should be
   named `yyyy-mm-dd-{slug-for-post}.md`

   If your post is html rather than markdown just change extension from `.md` to `.html`.

2. Add content. The structure should be:

        ---
        author: {Your Name}
        username: [optional] {your-user-name-if-you-have-one}
        title: {Title Like This - this is used both in page and html title}
        projects: [optional] {project slug, project slug...} (use if your post references Open Knowledge Labs projects)
        ---

        content in html or markdown goes here ....

   You need to quote any fields that contain a colon (:). For example,

        ---
        author: {Your Name}
        title: 'CatchyName: Doing this thing with that thing'
        ---

3. Add and commit the file then submit the pull request (if you are not pushing direct to the main repo)
