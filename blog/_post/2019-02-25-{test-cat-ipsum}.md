I know, the benefits of sharing knowledge and data may still be a bit murky. Hear me out and take a look at these 3 benefits.


##Variety of information 
Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, meowing chowing and wowing yet sleeps on my head but steal the warm chair right after you get up yet destroy couch as revenge. Love to play with owner's hair tie groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep your pillow is now my pet bed. Sit by the fire with tail in the air be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day but if it fits i sits but hide at bottom of staircase to trip human. My cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too pee in the shoe. 

Throw down all the stuff in the kitchen make meme, make cute face, thug cat stare at imaginary bug and knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish for ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl. Intrigued by the shower scratch the box sniff all the things so lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody, for the cat was chasing the mouse.

##Reliabilty of Data / Accuracy
Ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl hopped up on catnip, but tuxedo cats always looking dapper yet mewl for food at 4am. You have cat to be kitten me right meow. Cat ass trophy pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box bite nose of your human chew foot, woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run run around house drag poop on floor maybe it comes off woops left brown marks on floor human slave clean lick butt now for cat snacks poop in litter box, scratch the walls. 

Miaow then turn around and show you my bum stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring burrow under covers, or has closed eyes but still sees you find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day.

##Peace of Mind / Comfort
Meow meow, i tell my human stare out the window, so wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again yet stuff and things purr like an angel, attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. 

Sweet beast bite nose of your human or my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too. I could pee on this if i had the energy shake treat bag, yet sit and stare. 

Somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock slap kitten brother with paw. 

#Speed
Need to chase tail stares at human while pushing stuff off a table yet fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish for dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain yet lick the curtain just to be annoying and adventure always, so hack. 

Scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food mew, fall asleep upside-down yet good now the other hand, too but step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle . 

Pet me pet me pet me pet me, bite, scratch, why are you petting me scratch at the door then walk away so cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything for stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Swat at dog destroy house in 5 seconds, and a nice warm laptop for me to sit on for headbutt owner's knee. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain kitty power but cough furball and intently sniff hand.
