## Installation: 
>Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

---
## Usage: 
>The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

---
## Contributing: 
>Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.
