#Metadata on Datasets

>Metadata is data about data, data associated with an object, a document, or a dataset for purposes of description, administration, technical functionality and preservation. -Metadata Guides, University of Central Florida


Descriptive metadata serves the purpose of discovery, identification ad selection of a resource. The descriptive metadata standards includes common ones such as Dublin Core, the most widely used metadata standard for web resources, and TEI, Text Encoding Initiative standard for describing digital humanities and social sciences. It includes many domain specific metadata standards such as AgMES, CSDGM, DwC and EML.

Structural metadata describes the physical structure of resources, and it can be used to describe relationships between components in an object. METS, Metadata Encoding and Transmission standard, is an XML schema for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library.

Administrative metadata is related to the use and management of the digital objects, documents, or datasets. It has three types: technical metadata, rights management metadata and preservation metadata.

Research Data Types
Research data can be generated for different purposes and through different processes. Based on Research Information Network, it can include the following types of data:

Observational: data captured in real-time, usually irreplaceable. For example, sensor data, survey data, sample data, neuroimages.
Experimental: ldata from lab equipment, often reproducible, but can be expensive. For example, gene sequences, chromatograms, toroid magnetic field data.
Simulation: data generated from test models where model and metadata are more important than output data. For example, climate models, economic models.
Derived or compiled: data is reproducible but expensive. For example, text and data mining, compiled database, 3D models.
Reference or canonical: a (static or organic) conglomeration or collection of smaller (peer-reviewed) datasets, most probably published and curated. For example, gene sequence databanks, chemical structures, or spatial data portals.



Here's a bunch of resources on metadata for data sets
